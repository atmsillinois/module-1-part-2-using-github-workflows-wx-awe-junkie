# Heat Index Calculator

## Description
This calculator takes as inputs temperature and dewpoint in either degrees Fahrenheit or degrees Celcius, and from those inputs calculates the relative humidity and the heat index. It outputs the relative humidity, heat index, and specifies the difference between the heat index and the air temperature.

## Data Sources
- The equation used to calculate the heat index is from the National Weather Service, Weather Prediction Center's "The Heat Index Equation": https://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/html/heatindex_equation.shtml
- The equation used to calculate relative humidity is from Brian McNoldy's page at the University of Miami, "Calculate Temperature, Dewpoint, or Relative Humidity": https://bmcnoldy.earth.miami.edu/Humidity.html 

## Development
The original code development was done in the Jupyter Notebook "heat_index_calculator.ipynb", and the final version of the code was copied into heat_index_calculator.py to make it easily executable. 

This repository was branched into new_features to add the feature that calculates and outputs the difference between the heat index and the air temperature (last line of the code). Once successfully tested, it was merged back into the main branch.
